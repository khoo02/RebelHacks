# 🃏 BlackJack Brawl

A browser-based card game built for RebelHacks where blackjack meets fantasy. Fight monsters using the power of cards, unlock jokers.

## 🎮 Game Modes

**Fun Mode** — Fantasy blackjack. Battle monsters, collect Joker power-ups, and use special abilities to defeat enemies floor by floor. Features an endless mode once all bosses are defeated.

**Realistic Mode** — A standard blackjack casino simulator. No power-ups, just true casino rules and odds — great for learning the game.
